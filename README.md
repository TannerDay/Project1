From the home page, displaying a simple photo of the type of food served at the restaraunt, along with a quick and simple MOTO of the company "Its always BBQ Tme". Along with 3 nav bars at the top allowing easy and quick transportation to either the menu or the reservation page. The menu, displaying the dishes available at the restaraunt. And the reservaiton page, allowing for users to easily submit their name and phone number to secure a table at a time of their choosing.
